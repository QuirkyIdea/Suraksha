# Location Sharing Feature - Suraksha Safety App

## Overview
The Suraksha Safety App now includes a comprehensive location sharing feature that allows users to share their live location with emergency contacts via SMS. This feature enhances the safety capabilities of the app by providing real-time location information to trusted contacts.

## Features

### 1. Live Location Tracking
- **High Accuracy GPS**: Uses Google Play Services Location API for precise location data
- **Real-time Updates**: Location updates every 5-15 seconds when tracking is active
- **Background Operation**: Continues tracking even when app is in background

### 2. Location Sharing via SMS
- **Google Maps Integration**: Automatically generates Google Maps links for easy navigation
- **Individual Contact Sharing**: Share location with specific emergency contacts
- **Bulk Location Sharing**: Share location with all emergency contacts at once

### 3. Multiple Access Points
- **Home Screen**: Quick "Share Location" button in the main interface
- **Contacts Screen**: Individual location sharing buttons for each contact
- **Settings Screen**: Location sharing configuration and testing options

## How It Works

### Location Acquisition
1. App requests location permissions (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION)
2. Uses FusedLocationProviderClient for optimal battery life and accuracy
3. Implements fallback to last known location if current location unavailable

### SMS Generation
1. Formats location data into Google Maps URL: `https://maps.google.com/?q=lat,lng`
2. Creates comprehensive message with user info, timestamp, and location link
3. Automatically splits long messages if they exceed SMS character limits

### Contact Management
1. Integrates with existing emergency contacts system
2. Supports both individual and bulk location sharing
3. Records all location sharing events in safety records database
